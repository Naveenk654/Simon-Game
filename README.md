# 🎮 Simon Game

An interactive memory-based color sequence game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Inspired by the classic "Simon Says" game, this project challenges players to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of lights and sounds.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The game starts with a random color lighting up.
2. The user must click the color in the correct order.
3. With each new level, the sequence grows by one random color.
4. If the user makes a mistake, the game ends and can be restarted.
